## What is a container ?

Containers provide a way of creating an isolated environment, sometimes called a sandbox, in which applications and their dependencies can live. Multiple containers can run on the same machine and share the OS kernel with other containers, each running as isolated processes in user space. Containers take up less space than VMs (container images are typically tens of MBs in size), can handle more applications and require fewer VMs and Operating systems. A Docker container image is a lightweight, standalone, executable package of software that includes everything needed to run an application: code, runtime, system tools, system libraries and settings.

Ok, in shorts !!!

A container is a bundle of Applications, Application-libraries required to run your application and the minimum system dependencies.
